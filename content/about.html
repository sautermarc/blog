<p>My name is Marc Sauter and I am a junior data scientist.</p>
<div id="how-i-found-my-way-into-data-science" class="section level1">
<h1>How I found my way into data science</h1>
<p>The first introductory statistics course I had at university was in year 2015 where I was using an installation of the statistical software R version 3.2.2. In the following semester I found myself joining a masterâ€™s course on data science that would ultimately change my thinking. This is where I have picked up strategies to sort my files, have formed the habit of doing frequent backups, and have learned to apply statistical learning techniques. This was also when I have decided to switch from proprietary Windows to free software GNU Linux as my main operating system.</p>

<h1>Three reasons for writing this blog</h1>
<p>First of all, during the past ten years I have absorbed a lot of information in my studies with only few chances to write about it. I have taken more than hundred exams and begin to realize that I want to start sharing knowledge before I sign my next work contract.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am writing this blog because I want to keep track of my progression in data science. There are many obstacles to come.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to improve my english communication skills to a native level.</p>
